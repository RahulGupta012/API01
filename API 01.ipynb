Such a situation creats the problem to communicate between the systems, which are written in different languages. So for such kind of problem, there is a solution named API. If we say in few words then we can say that APIs are used in web applications to connect user-facing front ends with critical back-end functionality and data.\n",

If a user giving the command to payment app for sending some money to a person. Then the command always be in java script, which is unable to communicate with bank's script laguage C++. For such a situation API's are used. Even a single appliaction havn't devloped without API.\n",
